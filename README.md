Open Source Project for Beginner and Non-beginner
====

If you are bored with the idea of programming for money or not sure what you're passionate about. Or simplity think programming is so freaking difficult. Come to contribute to this open source project!

Imagine... we are at a crossroad... One way is saying, <em> "come and become a great hacker, kiddo." </em> 

Another way is saying, <em>"what am I supposed to do? Everything is so boring."</em>


This is the best place to come and left with your ideas. 


Once you vented out your idea, you make the rule for the next contributor to follow. I will organize the ideas once it is too messy to follow.

# Humans of New York
### Senario one
A grandpa who lost both of his legs during car accident, no longer able to play his favorite instrument: drumset, became a heavy heroin user. Frenquent Emergency Room visits. Grandpa having a huge conflict with her primary care doctor in a wellknown hospital. Grandpa thinks all the doctor care about is their research and money. Doctor refuses to talk with patient, and having an idea of grandpa is an unhelpable patient because grandpa is always on heroin. Grandpa wants to quit, grandpa even tried to go to rehab, however, everything is extremely difficult due to grandpa is on wheel chair and health condition, plus many rehab do not accept pt with wheel chair. A robot cannot help grandpa, what can? Grandpa is going to die out of hope.

### Senario two
Grandma has a pair of stubborn eyes. Grandma is living with her sister, both are old. Grandma like talking with people who care about her feeling and with similiar background. They probably could talk for years without identifying the root problems. But grandma did not know there is small logical way that perhaps could solve insignificant but perhaps big problem. Neither do care workers know if they are not logical enough. How to identify all those little problems by looking over their clouds of emotion and stubborness? Or maybe let it be and put it on music?

### Senerio three
Mental Health patient depend on a simple therapist too much, a change of therpist could result into their onset of their episodes. Nowadays therapist are changing so fast. How could these emotional dependency be lessened?

### Senario four
Suicidal aunt appear to be normal and well-functioned by day but hiding her deepest darkest thoughts until a well-trained psychologist dig it out after her overdose. 

### Senario Five
This whole thing do not make no freaking sense!

# My initial rule
I created a folder "Venting-Board" where you can vent the things that is bothering you. You could use .md file. You could also create other folder if the category do not belong to the "Venting-Board". I believe you all are better organizers!
You could also create subfolders under the "Venting-Board" if you could identify that you are venting under a specific category.

Happy contributing!
